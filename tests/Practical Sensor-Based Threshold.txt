🧠 Diagnostic Basis

According to the DSM-5 (psychiatric diagnostic manual):
A panic attack is a sudden surge of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes and is accompanied by ≥4 of these symptoms:

🔹 Core Symptoms:

Heart palpitations / pounding heart / accelerated heart rate

Sweating

Trembling or shaking

Shortness of breath or smothering sensation

Feelings of choking

Chest pain or discomfort

Nausea or abdominal distress

Dizziness, unsteadiness, lightheadedness, or faintness

Chills or heat sensations

Numbness or tingling (paresthesias)

Feelings of unreality (derealization) or detachment (depersonalization)

Fear of losing control or “going crazy”

Fear of dying

If 4 or more of these appear suddenly and peak within 10 minutes, it’s classified as a panic attack.

📊 Practical Sensor-Based Thresholds (Approximate)

If you’re designing detection hardware/software, here are physiological thresholds you can monitor (adjusted per person’s baseline):

Symptom	Approx. Threshold
Heart Rate (HR)	Sudden jump +30 bpm above baseline OR HR > 120 bpm at rest
Heart Rate Variability (HRV, RMSSD)	Drop of 30–50% from baseline (stress marker)
Breathing Rate	> 20 breaths/min (resting adult: 12–18)
GSR/EDA (sweat response)	Sharp spike: > 0.05–0.1 µS/sec increase
Tremor/Accel	Increased motion variance; hand tremors at 6–12 Hz
Skin Temp	Drop of 0.5–1°C in extremities (stress vasoconstriction)

These thresholds should be personalized by collecting baseline data at rest for each user.

🧩 Practical Rule for Your Device

A “panic alert” could trigger if:

Heart rate rises ≥30 bpm above baseline and

At least 1 more sign (GSR spike or fast breathing) is detected within a 2–3 minute window.

To align with DSM-5: If ≥4 signs (HR, breathing, tremor, sweating, etc.) appear together and last >1 minute, flag it as a likely panic attack.
