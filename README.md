---

## 📖 Usage Guide

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You MUST complete these steps in order! The system will not work without proper setup.

### 🎯 Step 1: Train Your Personal Baseline (REQUIRED)

**This step is MANDATORY before using the real-time predictor!**

```bash
cd RealTime_Panic_Detector
python realtime_baseline_trainer.py
```

**What happens:**
1. 🔌 Connects to Arduino via serial port
2. 📊 Collects 5 minutes of calm, relaxed sensor data
3. 🧮 Calculates YOUR personal normal levels
4. 💾 Saves baseline to `medical_baselines.pkl`

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Stay calm and relaxed during collection
- ✅ Ensure good sensor contact
- ✅ Avoid movement or stress
- ✅ Complete the full 5-minute collection

**Why this is required:**
- 🎯 Creates YOUR personal baseline (heart rate, EDA, breathing, etc.)
- 🚫 Without this, the system won't know YOUR normal levels
- ⚠️ The real-time predictor will fail without a personal baseline

### 🤖 Step 2: Prepare Machine Learning Models (REQUIRED)

**Choose ONE of these options:**

#### Option A: Use Pre-Trained Models (Recommended for beginners)

The repository includes pre-trained models in the `models/` folder. These are ready to use!

```bash
# Models are already included in the repository
# No additional training needed
ls models/
# You should see: medical_ensemble_model.pkl, medical_random_forest_model.pkl, etc.
```

#### Option B: Train Your Own Models (Advanced users)

```bash
# Go back to main directory
cd ..

# Train new models with your data
python medical_panic_trainer.py
```

**What happens:**
1. 📚 Loads WESAD dataset (if available)
2. 🧠 Trains 6 different ML models
3. 📊 Evaluates model performance
4. 💾 Saves trained models to `models/` folder

**Requirements for Option B:**
- ✅ WESAD dataset in the correct location
- ✅ Sufficient computational resources
- ✅ 2-3 hours for training

### 🚨 Step 3: Start Real-Time Monitoring

**Now you can use the real-time predictor!**

```bash
cd RealTime_Panic_Detector
python realtime_panic_predictor.py
```

**What happens:**
1. 📚 Loads YOUR personal baseline from Step 1
2. 🤖 Loads trained models from Step 2
3. 🔄 Starts continuous 30-second monitoring windows
4. 🧠 Runs ML prediction on each window
5. 🏥 Validates against clinical thresholds
6. 📱 Displays real-time alerts and status

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Personal baseline must be created (Step 1)
- ✅ Trained models must be available (Step 2)
- ✅ Arduino must be connected and working

### 📊 Step 3: Monitor Results

The system displays real-time information:

```
📊 14:30:25 - ✅ Normal stress levels - You're doing well!
   🤖 ML Probability: 15.2%
   🏥 Clinical Probability: 8.5%
   🎯 Combined Probability: 12.8%
   🚨 Alert Level: NORMAL
```

### 🎮 Advanced Usage

#### Training Custom Models

```bash
# Train new models with your data
python medical_panic_trainer.py
```

#### Testing Without Hardware

```bash
# Run simulation with synthetic data
python RealTime_Panic_Detector/demo_system.py
```

#### Batch Processing

```bash
# Process historical data
python RealTime_Panic_Detector/batch_processor.py --input data.csv --output results.json
```

### 🚨 Common Setup Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ Error: "No baseline found for user"

**Problem**: You tried to run `realtime_panic_predictor.py` without creating a baseline first.

**Solution**:
```bash
# You MUST run this first:
cd RealTime_Panic_Detector
python realtime_baseline_trainer.py
# Complete the 5-minute training session
# Then run the predictor:
python realtime_panic_predictor.py
```

#### ❌ Error: "Models not found"

**Problem**: The system can't find the trained ML models.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option 1: Use pre-trained models (recommended)
# Make sure the models/ folder exists with all .pkl files

# Option 2: Train your own models
cd ..
python medical_panic_trainer.py
cd RealTime_Panic_Detector
python realtime_panic_predictor.py
```

#### ❌ Error: "Arduino connection failed"

**Problem**: Can't connect to Arduino for baseline training.

**Solution**:
1. Check Arduino is connected via USB
2. Note the COM port (e.g., COM3, COM4)
3. Update the port in the script if needed
4. Ensure Arduino code is uploaded

#### ❌ Error: "Insufficient valid data for baseline calculation"

**Problem**: Not enough good sensor data during baseline training.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure sensors are properly connected
2. Stay completely still during the 5-minute session
3. Check sensor contact (especially heart rate and EDA)
4. Try again in a quiet, calm environment
