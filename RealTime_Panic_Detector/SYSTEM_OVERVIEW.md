## 🚀 How to Use the System

### Step 1: Setup
1. **Install Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Upload Arduino code:**
   - Open `arduino/realtime_sensor_reader.ino` in Arduino IDE
   - Upload to Arduino Uno
   - Note the COM port (e.g., COM3)

3. **Connect sensors to Arduino:**
   - Heart Rate Sensor → A0
   - EDA Sensor → A1
   - Temperature Sensor → A2
   - Respiration Sensor → A3
   - Accelerometer (MPU6050) → SDA/SCL pins

### Step 2: Create Personal Baseline
```bash
python realtime_baseline_trainer.py
```
- Enter your user ID
- Enter Arduino port (default: COM3)
- Stay calm and relaxed for 5 minutes
- Your personal baseline will be saved to `medical_baselines.pkl`

### Step 3: Start Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
python realtime_panic_predictor.py
```
- Enter your user ID
- Enter Arduino port (default: COM3)
- Enter models path
- System will start monitoring and alerting
